# thatonepercent
A collection of exponential growth visualization

# Project Name #


## Heading ##
  That One Percent - Visualize how small changes can make a huge difference when dealing with exponential growth.

## Sub-Heading ##
  “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.” 
  ― Albert A. Bartlett

  For the mathematically inclined and uninclined, That One Percent is way to explore the impact of changing small factors
  in situations. Play with the visualizations provided and apply small changes for big results in your life.

## Summary ##
  Users can input starting value, and time, and play with interest rate as a slider. A exponential growth curve will be displayed. They can hover over the growth curve at any particular point and get the value and time at the point. Above 
  the graph there is also a short display of how much growth has occurred, showing starting and values, and growth rate.

## Problem ##
  The power of exponential growth is often underestimated. This aims to give the user an accurate view of how the 
  exponential curve functions.

## Solution ##
  With inputs for starting value, ending value, and a slider for interest rate, users can play with each of these factors
  and get a feel for how each one affects output.

## Quote from You ##
  "Demystifying the power and complexity of exponential growth."

## How to Get Started ##
  Simply type in a starting value, time, and move the interest rate slider to point where you desire.
  The graph will update in real time.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I understand that a small change interest rate will make a huge in my outcome!!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Now that you have learned exponential growth works, apply it to your life! Look for lower interest rates on loans!
